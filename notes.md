Perfect! The "Notes" section has been successfully changed to "Summary" with an updated icon. Your portfolio now has a more professional label for that section. Since you're interested in more improvements, here are some additional enhancements I'd recommend: High Impact Additions:
Add Project Showcase Section - Display your actual projects (Job Search Platform, Social Media API) with links to GitHub repos
Make Resume & Portfolio PDFs Downloadable - Link to actual PDF files instead of "#"
Add GitHub Activity Widget - Show your contribution stats or recent activity
Add Smooth Scroll Animation - Make elements fade in as you scroll down the page
Add a "Download CV" Floating Button - Quick access to download your resume
Add Certifications Section - If you have any relevant certifications
Add Skills Progress Bars - Visual representation of proficiency levels
Add Contact Form - Instead of just email links
Add Testimonials/Recommendations - If you have any from clients or colleagues
Add Footer - With copyright, last updated date, and additional links
Quick Wins:
Add meta tags for better SEO and social media sharing
Add a favicon
Add Google Analytics (if you want to track visitors)
Add animations to the experience and skill cards
Add a "Back to Top" button
Would you like me to implement any of these? The Projects Showcase section would be particularly valuable since you already have the GitHub links in your CV!

I'll add a GitHub stats section to show your contribution activity. This will display your GitHub statistics using GitHub's stats cards.
